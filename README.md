# **PWA Sensor Management App**

This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed to manage and control connected devices and sensors. The app provides real-time monitoring and allows users to send commands to devices, such as changing wallpapers, colors, or data formats.

---

## **Features**
- View and manage connected sensors.
- Real-time data display with historical graphing.
- Send commands to update sensor settings.
- Cross-platform compatibility through a PWA interface.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

Run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Start the Development Server**
To start the app in development mode:
```bash
expo start,
"android": "expo start --android",
"ios": "expo start --ios",
"web": "expo start --web"

```

This will launch the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

### **4. Build for Production**
To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build files will be in the `build/` folder.

## **Running the App**

### **Development Mode**
1. Run `npm start`.
2. Open `http://localhost:8081/` in your browser.

### **Production Mode**
1. After running `npm run build`, you can serve the app using a static file server.
2. For example, use `serve`:
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   serve -s build
   ```
3. Open the provided URL in your browser.
